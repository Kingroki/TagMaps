# Windows

There are many ways to install python tools:

1. The recommended way to install the package is with `conda install tagmaps -c conda-forge`
2. For Windows users, an alternative is to download the newest pre-compiled build from [releases](../../releases) and run `tagmaps.exe`
3. If you need to install with pip, it is recommended to install all dependencies first (e.g. Windows users: use [Gohlke wheels](<https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>) if available) and then run `pip install tagmaps`

Of these 3 choices, **using conda is the one that I prefer**. For users who are not familiar with python package managers, please see the detailed instructions to install tagmaps with conda provided [here](../user-guide/installation/).

# Linux

Both `pip install tagmaps` and `conda install tagmaps -c conde-forge` are available to install tagmaps in Linux.
